Description: Methods and tools designed to improve the forecast accuracy for a linearly 
    constrained multiple time series, while fulfilling the linear/aggregation relationships 
    linking the components (Girolimetto and Di Fonzo, 2024 <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.03429>). 
    FoCo2 offers multi-task forecast combination and reconciliation 
    approaches leveraging input from multiple forecasting models or experts and ensuring 
    that the resulting forecasts satisfy specified linear constraints. In addition, linear 
    inequality constraints (e.g., non-negativity of the forecasts) can be imposed, if needed.
